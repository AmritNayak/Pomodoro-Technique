# Pomodoro-Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.<br />
The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

* Work/Study Time: 25 min
* Short Break Time: 5 min
* Long Break Time: 20 mins

## How the program works ?

* Click on the start button to start the work/study timer.
* Now you can do all your work and may minimize the program window, after the work timer reaches zero, the pomodoro window pops up and the break timer starts.
* Now you may take a short break, then similarly after the break timer reaches zero, the pomodoro window pops again and starts the work timer.
* After four work sessions, it's now time for a long break.
* At the mid-bottom, there's a mark that shows how many work sessions you have completed.
* You may click on the reset button if you want to reset your pomodoro progress and start again.

### A Pomodoro is 25 minutes because it's the perfect length of time to help you not procrastinate, be productive, create urgency and help you stay focused on any task you are tackling.
